# Data Privacy and Security Policy for Lead Agents

Data privacy and security are paramount. As Lead Agents, you handle sensitive prospect and customer information. Adhering to these guidelines is critical for legal compliance, maintaining trust, and protecting our company's reputation.

## I. Core Principles of Data Handling

1.  **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:** Always collect and process data legally, transparently, and fairly, with clear consent where required.
2.  **Purpose Limitation:** Collect data only for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes (e.g., lead qualification, sales outreach, nurturing). Do not process it further in a manner incompatible with those purposes.
3.  **Data Minimization:** Collect only the data that is absolutely necessary for the intended purpose. Avoid collecting excessive or irrelevant personal information.
4.  **Accuracy:** Ensure personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Promptly correct or erase inaccurate data.
5.  **Storage Limitation:** Retain data only for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.
6.  **Integrity and Confidentiality:** Process data in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.

## II. Key Regulations & Compliance

* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** Applies to the processing of personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area (EEA), regardless of where the processing takes place. Key aspects include:
    * Requiring explicit consent for certain data processing activities.
    * Granting individuals rights (e.g., right to access, rectification, erasure, data portability).
    * Mandating data breach notifications.
* **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):** Grants California consumers new rights regarding their personal information, including the right to know, delete, and opt-out of the sale of their personal information.
* **Other Regional/Industry-Specific Regulations:** Be aware that additional local laws (e.g., PIPEDA in Canada, LGPD in Brazil) or industry-specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare) may apply. Consult legal/compliance if unsure.

## III. Lead Agent Responsibilities

1.  **Consent:**
    * For inbound leads: Ensure that the forms used for data collection clearly state the purpose of data collection and link to our privacy policy.
    * For outbound leads: Ensure your outreach adheres to anti-spam laws (e.g., CAN-SPAM, CASL) regarding unsolicited commercial emails/calls. Do not add individuals to marketing lists without consent.
2.  **Data Accuracy & Updates:**
    * Keep lead/contact information in the CRM accurate and up-to-date (`crm_usage_guide.md`).
    * If a prospect requests their data to be updated or deleted, escalate the request to the Data Privacy Officer immediately.
3.  **Confidentiality:**
    * Do not share prospect or customer data with unauthorized individuals, internally or externally.
    * Discuss specific lead details only within secure, authorized channels (e.g., internal team meetings, secure communication platforms like Slack/Teams).
4.  **Data Access:**
    * Access prospect data only for legitimate business purposes directly related to your role.
    * Never attempt to access data outside your authorized permissions.

## IV. Security Best Practices

1.  **Password Management:**
    * Use strong, unique passwords for all company systems (CRM, SEP, email, AI-vengers platform).
    * Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) wherever possible.
    * Never share your passwords.
    * Change passwords regularly.
2.  **Phishing & Social Engineering Awareness:**
    * Be vigilant against suspicious emails, calls, or messages asking for credentials or sensitive information.
    * Verify the sender/caller if unsure. Report suspicious activity to IT immediately.
3.  **Device Security:**
    * Ensure your company-provided devices are password-protected and locked when not in use.
    * Do not install unauthorized software.
    * Keep operating systems and applications updated.
    * Use company-approved VPN when working remotely or on public Wi-Fi.
4.  **Secure Communication:**
    * Use encrypted communication channels for sensitive discussions (e.g., company email, secure messaging platforms).
    * Avoid discussing sensitive lead information in public or unsecure environments.
5.  **AI-vengers Specifics:**
    * Ensure all data processed by AI-vengers agents (e.g., call recordings, chat transcripts, email content) complies with data retention and privacy policies.
    * Understand and utilize any privacy-enhancing features within the AI-vengers platform (e.g., data anonymization, consent management).
    * If using the self-hosted option (`managed_vs_self_hosted.md`), ensure your infrastructure meets security standards.

## V. Reporting Security Incidents & Breaches

* **Immediate Action:** If you suspect or identify any data breach, security incident, or unauthorized access, report it immediately to your manager and the IT/Security department.
* **Do Not Investigate Alone:** Do not attempt to fix or investigate a security incident by yourself, as this can destroy forensic evidence.
* **Transparency:** Be prepared to assist in any necessary investigation and adhere to protocols for external notification if a breach is confirmed.

Compliance with this policy is mandatory. Violations can lead to disciplinary action, significant legal penalties for the company, and erosion of customer trust.
