### BYO Twilio SIP Trunking

Our platform allows users to bring their own Twilio SIP trunk.

You will need to configure an outbound trunk with:

- Trunk Name: My outbound trunk
- Address: multimodalagent.pstn.twilio.com
- Numbers: +17742925199
- Auth Username: multimodal
- Auth Password: e7kA8f4P77D52qt4Xg

You must manage your own credentials, routing, and call costs. We provide support for common SIP errors.

### Managed SIP Option

For mere $20/month, we offer fully managed SIP trunking. We handle provisioning, authentication, and routing so you donâ€™t have to.
