### Multimodal AI Agents

Our platform supports multimodal agents that combine:

- **Voice** (via LiveKit)
- **Text chat**
- **Visual input** (image-to-text)(Beta and may be pushed in next version)

You can mix modalities to create rich user experiences, such as:

- Voice agents for support
- Text agents for lead qualification
- Future support for visual forms (OCR intake)

All modalities use a shared agent logic and tools.
