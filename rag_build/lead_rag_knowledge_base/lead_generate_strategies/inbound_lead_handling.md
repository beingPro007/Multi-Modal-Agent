# Inbound Lead Handling

This guide outlines the process for effectively handling inbound leads generated from various channels (e.g., website forms, content downloads, direct inquiries). Prompt and intelligent handling of inbound leads is crucial for maximizing conversion rates.

## I. Inbound Lead Sources

Inbound leads can originate from:
* **Website Forms:** Contact Us, Demo Request, Download Content (eBook, Whitepaper, Case Study).
* **Live Chat:** Interactions through the website's chat widget.
* **Direct Inquiries:** Emails or phone calls directly to general inquiry lines.
* **Trial Sign-ups:** Freely available trials of the product/service.
* **Webinars/Events:** Leads from attendees or registrants of online/offline events.

## II. Initial Response & Speed-to-Lead

1.  **Automated Acknowledgment:**
    * **Action:** Immediately after lead submission, an automated email acknowledgment should be sent.
    * **Purpose:** Confirms receipt, sets expectations, and provides initial useful content (e.g., link to relevant article, thank you message).

2.  **Rapid AI Agent Engagement:**
    * **Action:** AI-vengers agents should be deployed to engage inbound leads as quickly as possible (ideally within 5 minutes for high-intent leads).
    * **Method:**
        * **High-Intent (Demo/Contact Us):** Initiate an automated call (if phone number provided) or a personalized email/chat follow-up to qualify further and schedule a discovery call with an Account Executive.
        * **Low-Intent (Content Download):** Initiate a nurturing sequence via email or chat to provide more relevant content and gently qualify over time.
    * **Goal:** Capitalize on the prospect's immediate interest. Studies show conversion rates drop dramatically after the first 5-10 minutes.

## III. Lead Qualification & Routing

1.  **Pre-Qualification by AI Agent:**
    * **Action:** The AI-vengers agent will engage the lead using a pre-defined qualification script (based on BANT, MEDDIC, etc., as per `lead_qualification_criteria.md`).
    * **Key Data Points to Collect:**
        * Company size, industry, role.
        * Expressed pain points or challenges.
        * Budget and timeline considerations.
        * Decision-making authority.
    * **Outcome:** Determine if the lead is an MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead) or an SQL (Sales Qualified Lead).

2.  **CRM Update:**
    * **Action:** All interactions and collected qualification data must be logged immediately and accurately in the CRM (`crm_usage_guide.md`).
    * **Status Update:** Update the lead status based on qualification outcome (e.g., "New Lead," "MQL - Engaged," "SQL - Meeting Booked," "Disqualified").

3.  **Routing to Human Sales Reps:**
    * **Action:** Only **SQLs** (leads with sufficient qualification and expressed interest in a follow-up) should be routed to human Account Executives (AEs).
    * **Process:**
        * If a meeting is booked by the AI agent, ensure the AE's calendar is updated and a calendar invite is sent.
        * Provide the AE with a summary of the AI agent's qualification conversation and key findings.
    * **Why:** Ensures human sales reps spend their time on the most promising opportunities.

## IV. Nurturing Disqualified or Low-Intent Leads

1.  **Nurturing Cadences:**
    * **Action:** Leads that are not immediately qualified (e.g., wrong fit, no immediate need, low engagement) should be entered into appropriate nurturing sequences (`lead_nurturing_strategies.md`).
    * **Purpose:** To build awareness, provide value, and keep the company top-of-mind until the prospect's needs align.
2.  **Re-engagement Triggers:**
    * **Action:** Monitor engagement with nurturing content (email opens, clicks, website visits).
    * **Outcome:** If engagement increases or a specific action is taken (e.g., visiting pricing page), re-evaluate for re-qualification by an AI agent or direct human outreach.

## V. Best Practices for Inbound Handling

* **Consistency:** Ensure all inbound leads receive a consistent initial experience, regardless of source.
* **Personalization:** Leverage available lead data to personalize automated and agent-led interactions.
* **Clear Handoffs:** Ensure smooth transitions from AI agent to human sales rep, with all necessary context provided.
* **Continuous Optimization:** Regularly review inbound lead performance metrics (response time, conversion rates) and adjust strategies as needed.
