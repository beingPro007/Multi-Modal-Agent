# Lead Qualification Criteria

This document outlines the criteria used to qualify leads, determining their readiness and suitability for sales engagement. A qualified lead demonstrates a higher likelihood of conversion into a customer.

## Key Qualification Frameworks

We primarily use a combination of **BANT** and **MEDDIC** principles, adapted to our specific business context.

### 1. BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)

* **Budget:**
    * Does the lead have the financial capacity to purchase our solution?
    * Have they allocated budget, or is there a clear plan to secure funding?
    * *Questions:* "Do you have a budget allocated for this initiative?" or "What's your typical budget range for solutions like ours?"
* **Authority:**
    * Is the lead the decision-maker, or do they influence the decision?
    * Who else needs to be involved in the decision-making process?
    * *Questions:* "Who else on your team needs to be involved in this decision?" or "What's the typical approval process for new solutions?"
* **Need:**
    * Does the lead have a clear pain point or problem that our solution can solve?
    * Do they understand the value and benefits our solution offers?
    * *Questions:* "What are the biggest challenges you're currently facing in this area?" or "How do you envision our solution helping to address that challenge?"
* **Timeline:**
    * When does the lead plan to implement a solution?
    * Is there an urgent need, or is it a long-term project?
    * *Questions:* "What's your anticipated timeline for implementing a solution?" or "Are there any deadlines driving this initiative?"

### 2. MEDDIC (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion)

* **Metrics:**
    * What quantifiable results is the lead looking to achieve?
    * How will they measure the success of a new solution?
    * *Questions:* "How will you measure the success of this project?" or "What's the impact of this problem on your business metrics?"
* **Economic Buyer:**
    * Who controls the budget and has the final say on the purchase?
    * *Questions:* "Who is the primary decision-maker from a financial perspective?" or "Who needs to sign off on the budget?"
* **Decision Criteria:**
    * What are the technical, functional, and commercial requirements for a solution?
    * What are the must-haves versus nice-to-haves?
    * *Questions:* "What are the key factors you'll consider when evaluating solutions?" or "What's most important to you in a new vendor?"
* **Decision Process:**
    * What are the formal and informal steps involved in making a purchase decision?
    * Who are all the stakeholders involved and what is their role?
    * *Questions:* "Can you walk me through your typical decision-making process for new software/solutions?" or "What steps are involved after our meeting today?"
* **Identify Pain:**
    * What are the specific, impactful problems the lead is experiencing?
    * What are the consequences of not addressing these pains?
    * *Questions:* "What are the biggest frustrations you're experiencing with your current process/solution?" or "What's the cost of inaction for your organization?"
* **Champion:**
    * Is there an internal advocate who believes in our solution and will help us navigate the organization?
    * *Questions:* "Who on your team is most excited about finding a solution to this problem?" or "Who would be our internal advocate for this project?"

## Lead Scoring Integration

These qualification criteria directly feed into our lead scoring model. Leads that meet more of these criteria will receive higher scores and be prioritized for sales engagement.

## Unqualified Leads

Leads that do not meet minimum qualification criteria should be moved to a nurturing track or disqualified with clear reasons documented in the CRM.
