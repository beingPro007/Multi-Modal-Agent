# Feedback and Coaching Guide for Lead Agents

Effective feedback and coaching are vital for the continuous development, performance improvement, and morale of Lead Agents. This guide provides best practices for both giving and receiving constructive feedback.

## I. Principles of Effective Feedback

1.  **Timely:** Deliver feedback as close to the event as possible to ensure clarity and relevance.
2.  **Specific:** Focus on observable behaviors or actions, not generalizations or personality traits.
    * *Instead of:* "You're not good at calls."
    * *Use:* "On your last call with Prospect X, I noticed you didn't ask about their budget after they expressed a clear need."
3.  **Actionable:** Feedback should suggest clear steps the agent can take to improve.
    * *Instead of:* "Do better next time."
    * *Use:* "Next time, try using the BANT framework from `lead_qualification_criteria.md` to ensure you cover budget in your discovery."
4.  **Balanced:** While focusing on areas for improvement, also highlight strengths and positive contributions.
5.  **Two-Way:** Encourage the agent to reflect on their own performance and offer their perspective. It's a dialogue, not a monologue.
6.  **Forward-Looking:** Focus on what can be done differently in the future, rather than dwelling on past mistakes.

## II. Giving Feedback (For Managers/Coaches)

### A. Preparation
* **Observe:** Listen to calls, read emails, review CRM notes.
* **Gather Data:** Pull relevant metrics from `agent_performance_metrics.md` dashboards.
* **Identify 1-2 Key Focus Areas:** Don't overwhelm the agent with too much at once.
* **Prepare Specific Examples:** Have timestamps from calls or specific email excerpts ready.

### B. The Feedback Conversation Structure
1.  **Set the Stage (Briefly):**
    * "Thanks for meeting. Today, I want to discuss your recent calls/emails, focusing on [specific area, e.g., discovery questions]."
    * "My goal is to help you continue to grow and succeed."
2.  **State the Observation (Specific & Neutral):**
    * "On the call with [Prospect Name] on [Date], I noticed that after they mentioned [Pain Point], you moved directly to pitching features rather than asking a follow-up question about the impact of that pain."
3.  **Explain the Impact:**
    * "This might have led to missing a deeper understanding of their needs, which could make it harder to tailor our solution effectively."
4.  **Listen to Their Perspective:**
    * "What were you thinking at that moment?" or "What's your take on that interaction?"
5.  **Provide Guidance/Recommendation:**
    * "Going forward, when a prospect mentions a pain, I'd suggest pausing and asking, 'What impact does that have on your team/business?' to uncover the true scope of the problem."
    * "Let's review `objection_handling_scripts.md` together, specifically the section on uncovering the 'root' of an objection."
6.  **Agree on Action Steps:**
    * "So, for your next 5 calls, let's focus specifically on asking a follow-up 'impact' question after a pain point is mentioned. I'll listen to a few and we can check in."
7.  **Offer Support:**
    * "I'm here to support you. Let me know if you want to role-play or discuss any challenging calls."
8.  **End Positively:** Reiterate confidence in their abilities.

## III. Receiving Feedback (For Lead Agents)

1.  **Listen Actively:** Don't interrupt. Let your manager complete their thoughts.
2.  **Avoid Defensiveness:** It's natural to feel defensive, but try to control this instinct. Feedback is about growth, not blame.
3.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** "Can you give me a specific example of what you mean by that?", "When did that happen?"
4.  **Seek to Understand the "Why":** Ask about the impact of your actions. "How did that impact the call outcome?"
5.  **Take Notes:** Jot down key points and actionable suggestions.
6.  **Reflect & Self-Assess:** After the conversation, think about the feedback and how it aligns with your own perceptions.
7.  **Formulate Action Steps:** Work with your manager to create clear, measurable steps you can take to improve.
8.  **Follow Up:** Proactively update your manager on your progress or ask for further coaching.
    * "I tried the new opening line you suggested; here's how it went on my last 3 calls."

## IV. Coaching vs. Feedback

* **Feedback:** Is retrospective, focuses on past performance, and provides information on what happened.
* **Coaching:** Is prospective, focuses on future performance, and helps the individual develop new skills or insights.
    * **Coaching Questions:**
        * "What do you think went well on that call?"
        * "What would you do differently next time?"
        * "What's one thing you want to work on this week?"
        * "What resources (e.g., specific MD file, training) could help you with this?"

This guide should be used in conjunction with ongoing 1:1s and regular performance reviews.
