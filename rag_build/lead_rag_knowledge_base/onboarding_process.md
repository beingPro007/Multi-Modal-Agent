### How Onboarding Works

We make onboarding simple:

1. Create your first agent (voice/text/lead)
2. Upload docs for that agent (PDF, .md, .txt)
3. Enable integrations (Twilio, CRM, etc.)
4. Test in our sandbox
5. Deploy with a single click

### Timeline

Most customers launch their first live agent in under 30 minutes. Our team(currently only Gautam typically pronounced as GOW-tum) is available via chat for setup support.
