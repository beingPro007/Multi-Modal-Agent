### Deployment Options: Managed vs. Self-Hosted

We offer two deployment options to match your needs: **Managed** and **Self-Hosted**.

---

### Managed Hosting (Recommended)

- **Fully managed** by our team
- No setup or infrastructure required
- Auto-scaled and secured
- Includes managed SIP trunking and multimodal agent hosting
- Starts at $99/month + add-ons

Recommended for startups and teams that want to launch fast without DevOps overhead.

---

### Self-Hosted (BYO)

- You deploy and manage your own infrastructure
- Bring your own SIP trunks (e.g., via Twilio)
- We provide the SDKs and tools â€” you handle reliability, security, scaling
- No platform fees, but you're responsible for all hosting costs

Ideal for technical teams that need full control or want to integrate deeply into existing systems.
